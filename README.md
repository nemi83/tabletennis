# Table Tennis
VBA algorithm that calculates if players have the same number of wins and losses. The methodology was extracted from the Handbook for Tournament Referees published at ITTF website. 

The repository contains few items:
1. a separate file on which raw VBA code was written. When players in the prequalification tables have the same amount of wins and losses, the algorithm first checks the sets won by the player and if the number of won and lost sets is the same, the algorithm goes a step further and calculates the points accumulated in each sets by each player, and then changes the position accordingly to player's place in the table. 

2. A complete and working .xlsm file. Comments and content are still in Slovene, since this file was originally created by the NTZS (Slovene table tennis association), I just added the behind the scene VBA code to it. In case you need to know of some tricks in VBA, there are plenty of challenges to work with. 

I hope you enjoy it and make your life with VBA a bit less stressful.

Hope the file will serve well when organizing table tennis tournaments around the world.
