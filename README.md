VBA algorithm that calculates if players have the same number of wins and losses by the ITTF algorithm

There is the separate file on which the raw VBA code was written and is working extremely well. When players in the prequalification tables have the same amount of wins and losses the algorithm first checks the sets won by the player and if number of won andlost sets is the same, the algorithm goes a step further and calculates the points accumulated in each sets, and then changes the position accordingly to player's place in the table. 
Comments and content are still in Slovene, since this file was originally created by the NTZS (Slovene table tennis association), I just added the behind the scene VBA code to it. in case you need to know of some tricks in VBA, there are plenty of challenges to 
work with. 

I hope you enjoy it and make your life with VBA a bit less stressful. A bigger project regarding the same idea is in the 
making where excellent players are used.

Hope the file will serve well when organizing table tennis tournaments around the world.
